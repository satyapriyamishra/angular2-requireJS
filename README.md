# angular2-requirejs

[![devDependencies Status](https://david-dm.org/thibaultboursier/angular2-requirejs/status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/thibaultboursier/angular2-requirejs)

Simple project implementing Angular 2.x with RequireJS AMD, written in ECMAScript 5.
It doesn't use any loaders like SystemJS or Webpack. It's useful for projects which have a RequireJS legacy and need to implement AngularJS 2.x for some parts.

First, install NPM dependencies.
```
npm install
```
Then, run lite-server (port 8000) :
```
lite-server
```
Next step is to make components registered on the fly.
